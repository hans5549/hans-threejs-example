# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]  
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

### Constitutional Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  These requirements are derived from the project constitution and must be addressed.
  Mark each as "Applicable" or "N/A" with justification.
-->

#### Code Quality (Constitution I)
- [ ] Code review process defined
- [ ] Static analysis tools configured
- [ ] Naming conventions and style guide followed
- [ ] SOLID principles considered in design

#### Testing (Constitution II - NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- [ ] TDD approach will be followed (red-green-refactor)
- [ ] Unit test coverage target: ≥ 80% (critical paths: 100%)
- [ ] Integration tests defined for component interactions
- [ ] Contract tests defined for API boundaries
- [ ] All tests will be written BEFORE implementation

#### User Experience (Constitution III)
- [ ] UI components follow design system or have consistency plan
- [ ] Accessibility requirements defined (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Responsive design requirements specified
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly and actionable
- [ ] Loading states and async feedback mechanisms planned
- [ ] [If N/A: Feature has no user-facing interface]

#### Performance (Constitution IV)
- [ ] Response time targets defined (API: <200ms, UI: FCP <1.5s, TTI <3.5s)
- [ ] Performance budget set (bundle size, images, memory)
- [ ] Performance testing strategy planned
- [ ] Monitoring and observability considered
- [ ] Scalability requirements assessed

#### Documentation Language (Constitution V - NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- [ ] This specification written in Traditional Chinese
- [ ] User-facing documentation will be in Traditional Chinese
- [ ] Code comments will be in English (business logic may use Traditional Chinese)
- [ ] Internal communication will use Traditional Chinese

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Users can complete account creation in under 2 minutes"]
- **SC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "System handles 1000 concurrent users without degradation"]
- **SC-003**: [User satisfaction metric, e.g., "90% of users successfully complete primary task on first attempt"]
- **SC-004**: [Business metric, e.g., "Reduce support tickets related to [X] by 50%"]
